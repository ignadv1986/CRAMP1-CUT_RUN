# CRAMP1-CUT_RUN
CUT&RUN analysis of CRAMP1 protein in human cells
## Project summary
In this project we analyzed the ability of CRAMP1 WT and 2 different mutants to bind DNA, and characterize the regions to which they bind most efficiently through CUT&RUN.
The experiment was carried out in human osteosarcoma CRAMP1 KO U2OS cells, reconstituted with inducibly-expressing GFP-CRAMP1 WT, ∆SANT or ∆D1. Cells expressing an empty GFP vector were used as control.
