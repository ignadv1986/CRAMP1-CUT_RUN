# CRAMP1-CUT_RUN
CUT&RUN analysis of CRAMP1 protein in human cells

## Project summary
In this project, we analyzed the DNA-binding ability of wild-type CRAMP1 and two distinct mutants (∆SANT and ∆D1) using CUT&RUN. The experiment was performed in CRAMP1 knockout human osteosarcoma U2OS cells reconstituted with inducible expression of GFP-tagged CRAMP1 WT, ∆SANT, or ∆D1. Cells expressing an empty GFP vector served as a control.

The experimental procedures are detailed in [this publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276525003090?via%3Dihub)

Here, we present the bioinformatics workflow used to process and analyze the resulting sequencing data, highlighting key quality control steps, peak calling, and downstream interpretation.
